  <p class="govuk-body">
     This accessibility statement applies to the Fraud Referral Capture form hosted on GOV.UK. <br/> <br/> This is a citizen facing application. This application enables citizens to report someone of committing suspected benefit fraud online. The service allows citizens to state what they think is happening and who is involved. Information is relayed to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) agents who decide whether there is enough information to launch an investigation. <br/> <br/> We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:
  </p>
  <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced'>
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>listen to the entire service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">
     We have also made the service text as simple as possible to understand. <br/> <br/> AbilityNet has helpful advice on <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk" target="_blank">how to make your device easier to use (opens in a new tab)</a>.

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Enforcement procedure</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
     The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). <br/> <br/> If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com" target="_blank">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (opens in a new tab)</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
     DWP is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Compliance status</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
     This service is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 AA standard (opens in a new tab)</a>. <br/> <br/> We have identified an issue that could affect all users in a rare scenario. Users of assistive technology may be unable to identify what is causing the problem if the issue does occur. This could mean that they are unable to complete the required actions to submit a fraud allegation to the department. The issue is described as follows:
  </p>
  <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced'>
    <li>User has selected the ‘not declaring savings or other non-work related income’ screen and chooses the option ‘sale of something’</li>
    <li>Text input area has a 500 character limit and users can progress as expected providing they do not exceed this</li>
    <li>If user selects ‘submit’ and then selects the ‘back’ link from the next screen any input on the ‘not declaring savings...’ screen will still be visible and can be amended. If the input includes ‘returns’ in the text, an additional space is generated when they go back to this input. The additional space or spaces will be included in the character count</li>
    <li>This may mean the character count will be exceeded and a generic validation error will be generated on selecting submit</li>
    <li>Users of assistive technology may be unable to identify that the additional spaces have contributed to the character count.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">
     This service was last tested in June 2025. The testing was carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions, using a sampled approach to cover as many different components and design patterns as possible. Testing was carried out using a combination of automated and manual testing, including assistive technologies VoiceOver, VoiceControl and Zoom. <br/> <br/> This statement was prepared on 30 June 2025.
